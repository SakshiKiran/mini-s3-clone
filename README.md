I’ve built this as an **MVP**—a basic, working S3-like service that I’m actively iterating on. The Spring Boot 3.5.6 backend (Java 17) supports bucket creation, object uploads/downloads, listings, and deletions, storing files and JSON metadata in a local storage/ folder to avoid cloud costs. Lombok reduces boilerplate, Jackson handles JSON, and the Maven Wrapper ensures consistent builds.

The React/Vite frontend (Node 18, React 18.2.0, Vite 4.3.9) lets you create buckets, upload files, browse contents, download objects, and delete them via Axios-powered REST calls. Authentication, testing, CI, and a transition to a full S3 emulator (LocalStack or MinIO) are on the roadmap. To try the MVP now, run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` in the backend, then `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the frontend, and point your browser to http://localhost:5173.
